Model: Data Security
  @success
  Attack: Force deletion of sensitive and critical data
    When frontend requests for a deletion of records
    Then that data is deleted without leaving any traces
  Defense: Delete requests should only disable a record, not delete it
    Given table schema has a 'status' column 
    And 'active' and 'disabled' are valid values for 'status' column
    When frontend requests for a deletion of records
    Then set the 'status' field of that record to 'disabled'
  # Instead of delete operation, have a column that indicates if a row is 'active' or 'disabled'
