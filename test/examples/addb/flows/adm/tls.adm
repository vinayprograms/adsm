Model: TLS security

  Attack: Exploit insecure TLS ciphers
    Given Target supports TLS v1.0 or v1.1
    When Target is scanned for insecure ciphers
    Then Insecure ciphers are exploited by attackers
    And sensitive in-transit data is exposed to attackers

  Defense: Take target off public internet
    When Target is scanned for insecure ciphers
    And target is not required to be exposed to Internet
    Then block all access to target from Internet

  Defense: Turn off insecure ciphers
    Given Target supports TLS v1.0 or v1.1
    When Target is scanned for insecure ciphers
    And TLS v1.0 and v1.1 cannot be turned off
    Then configure target to not support insecure ciphers from these versions of TLS
